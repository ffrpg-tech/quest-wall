			Farm RPG has no shortage of quest data — <a

			already covers every questline and item. What it doesn't have is a checklist. So people make their
			own: <strong>Quest Wall</strong> sheets, one questline at a time. However, it is mainly focused
			on main quests, and not the rest of the questlines. So the other quests are left without getting its own sheet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, because the sheets only cover one questline at a time, it is hard to see the bigger picture.
			While it is true that we must focus on one at a time, it is also true that we need to plan ahead. Say you
			have two sheets tackling different questlines — you end up syncing the same inventory into both by hand,
			and still have to manually check whether you have enough items to clear the next quest on either one.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's exactly what happened to me while working on my ATI quest, and I could tell it wouldn't stop being a problem once ATI was done.
			So I decided to build a tool that could plan out questlines and show where I — and anyone else — would wall.
			I wanted it to be usable by anyone too, so with my knowledge towards software development, I made it as a web application, accessible from desktop and mobile.
		</p>
		<p>
			The premise is: paste your inventory and your finished questlines, then pick your next questlines — it walks the chain and shows you exactly where you
			run dry.
